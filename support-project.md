# Support the TTN Mapper / CoverageMap project

> **Current Funding** 
> * Patreon: 3.5% 
> * Ad revenue: 0.5%
> * Loss: 96%

The server hosting costs for the mapping system is a substantial amount each month. 
The project's future can only be guaranteed if these hosting costs are covered.

The project's monthly running costs were covered by The Shuttleworth Foundation up to 2018. 
At this point there is no financial support from any official sources. 

There are two ways we are trying to fund the project:
* Community support via donations
* Selling white labelled private instances of the mapper
